These are the protected function files of the Penalized blind Kriging model. Please open the example.m and look at how to use it.

Welcome to give your feedback to us.

Before you run the codes, you need the penalized toolbox [1]. You can download it from here: https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v072i06

And I extract some codes from the SURROGATES toolbox [2]. I also advice you to use this toolbox. You can download it from here: https://sites.google.com/site/srgtstoolbox/

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us: gfkdzhangyi@126.com (Yi Zhang, PhD candidate) or wendy0782@126.com (Prof. Wen Yao)
